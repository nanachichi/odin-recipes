    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These are moist and delicious despite the fact that there is no liquid other than the berry juice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ cups chopped fresh strawberries</li>
      <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>¼ cup butter, softened</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a small bowl, combine the strawberries and 1/2 cup sugar. Set aside for 1 hour. 
        Drain, reserving liquid and berries separately.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a 12 cup muffin tin, or line with paper liners.</li>
      <li>In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and 1/4 cup sugar until light and fluffy. 
        Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt and nutmeg; 
        stir into the creamed mixture alternately with the juice from the berries. 
        Gently stir in the berries. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.</li>
      <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the tops spring back when lightly touched. 
        Cool in the pan on a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
